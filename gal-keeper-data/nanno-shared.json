      "description": "Kawano Hatsuyuki is a third-year student, one of the rare delinquents at Shirosaki Gakuen. He reluctantly shows up in order to fulfill his graduation requirements.\n\nIt's December, and the first snow of the year has fallen. In one lot of the old town, Hatsuyuki encounters a beautiful girl wearing a white dress. She's wandering the streets under the falling snow, in search of her rabbit. A few days later, the girl in the dress, Sakura, transfers into his school, in order to take Hatsuyuki along towards the last winter.\n\nWith the turn of the four seasons, 1095 days come to an end. Soon winter will pass, and spring will arrive. Embracing memories of snow that never accumulated, the youth stands perfectly still.\n\nFrom the first snow (Hatsuyuki) to cherry blossoms (Sakura), congratulations on your graduation.",

But these unlucky individuals do not return as the person they once were. They rise from the grave with depleted cognition, memory, and awareness. Their bodies, stripped of all regenerative abilities, slowly rot away.\n\nIn Japan, those with this affliction are known as \"hihiru.\" Though once revered as holy beings, over time they have come to be shunned and reviled by society. Eventually, however, their condition was recognized as a medical issue, and given the name Aerodema.\n\nNow, at the dawn of the Taishou Era, Dr. Katori Shuuhei is conducting field studies in an effort to improve living conditions and support systems for Aerodema patients. Given how slowly they have developed in Japan compared to other nations, it is an uphill battle he fights.\n\nIt is through the eyes of two men that this story will unfold: Chigusa Masamitsu, a young doctor assisting with these studies, and Tenma Takeo, a student to whom Aerodema has only been a distant problem until now. Watch how these men grapple with Aerodema as it twists itself into their lives...\n\n[Edited from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2314820/]Steam[/url]]",

He doesn't attend his club, he doesn't put much effort in his studies, all he does is show up at his part time job; in short, his life could be better. One day, he meets a strange girl, Kirari Shiino, at work and before he knows it, they've formed a punk band.\n\nThe band consists of Shikanosuke, Kirari, his childhood friend Chie Isurugi, and a rich but weak young lady by the name of Sarina Kashiwara. The four of them are members of the Second Literature Club, which has hardly any active members and is already scheduled to be disbanded. This band is their chance to stand out and give one final farewell at the Culture Festival.\n\nThe challenge was foolhardy, but after eccentric training they managed to succeed and rock out the peaceful Oubi Academy with their debut performance. That should have been it.\nThey were satisfied.\nThey should have returned to their normal lives.\nHowever, their final performance at a local Live House became a hit on the Internet and requests for their performance start flying in from far and wide.\n\nOne problem: exams are coming up and their parents are opposed to the band!\n\nWho cares!\n\nThe four of them embark on their final adventure, a long tour of Japan, armed with their dreams and their instruments, all aboard a rickety van that could fall apart at any moment.\n\n\"First stop, Nagoya!\"\n\n[From [url=http://www.mangagamer.com/r18/Titles/Details/2609C708-8684-42E1-92F0-17ED568F3CED/kirakira]Mangagamer[/url]]",

She lives alone except for her pet dog Qoo, and she holds down a part-time job as a waitress at Dragon Burger. Her life is busy and content, but sometimes she feels like there's something she's forgetting, something she left undone. Maybe even something important.\n\nOne day Alice and her friends visit the clock tower. There, an unusual book falls into Alice's lap: the diary of a mysterious and rather perverted young man. Why do all the girls Alice meets show up in the diary? Why does nobody remember the events in the diary? And why does Alice feel so strongly that she wants to meet that young man?",

However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia. \n\nTennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\n\n[Partially taken from [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_(visual_novel)]Wikipedia[/url]]",

After an incident, almost half of LeMU becomes flooded, and the path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off. In addition, LeMU is under constant assault by severe water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours. Escape is not the only concern, however; many questions arise as to the legitimacy of the accident and whether or not those trapped there were brought there for a purpose.\n\n[From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_17:_The_Out_of_Infinity]Wikipedia[/url]]",

      "description": "For two years, snow had been falling continuously in the town of Tsukigasaki with spring nowhere in sight. Aside from the snow which never built up, the town was also struck by other abnormal incidents, such as tornadoes, thunderbolts and floods. Riku is an ‘elfin’ who possesses a mysterious ability known as ‘rune’, which he uses to save others. He returned to Tsukigasaki, where he grew up in an orphanage, along with fellow elfins Rinne and Hinata. Their duty was to protect two young sisters, Ochiba and Hazuki, from rune abilities which go out of control, while also keeping the existence of elfins a secret to the public.\n\nWhen he arrived at the town, a girl in a pure white dress was waiting for him. He used to play with the girl Yuuki when they were small, having snowball fights and making snowmen. To his surprise, she still looked exactly the same as before he left. While she’s sad that the city has since changed a lot, she told him that he still remained the same to her even if he grows up.\n\n[From [url=http://omochikaeri.wordpress.com/2014/07/05/july-2014-eroge-releases/]Hau~ Omochikaeri![/url]]",

      "description": "Subarashiki Hibi is a story told in seven chapters. The story follows a group of several Tokyo high school students mostly through July of 2012 and each chapter is told from the perspective of one of its five main characters. Because of the same timeframe coverage, certain events are overlapping from chapter to chapter but at the core of it all is a mystery revolving around the prophecy about the end of the world on July the 20th as well as the events that are following before the said date. The first part of the VN is used to make a setting for the said mysteries while the second part is about uncovering the truth behind them all.\n\nThe story begins in chapter #1, 'Down the Rabbit-Hole I\" on July 12, 2012. The protagonist, Minakami Yuki, lives a peaceful everyday life with Tsukasa and Kagami, her childhood friends, when one day she meets a mysterious girl, Takashima Zakuro (a girl in another class in Yuki's school, who seems to have met Yuki before but Yuki doesn't remember her). The strange schoolmate Yuki just befriended moves into her house (Yuki doesn't mind too much about that). Then following this new guest in Minakami's residence, Yuki's two childhood friends mentioned earlier also move in, just so that they don't feel left out. These events are just a prelude for what will ultimately lead Yuki to discover her own \"Wonderful Everyday\" during this chapter.\n\nIn chapter #2, [spoiler]\"Down the Rabbit-Hole II\", the story still follows Minakami Yuki in the same timeline as before albeit with a different set of events and their outcomes. This time, Yuki learns that Takashima Zakuro has killed herself. Rumours in school are abuzz about predictions of the end of the world in 2012 - one of which is a Web site called the \"Web Bot Project\", a network of crawlers designed to harness the 'collective unconsciousness' to make predictions. A boy in Yuki's class named Mamiya Takuji stands up and makes an apocalyptic prediction, stating that the world will end on the 20th, that Zakuro's death was the first sign. He speaks of an event he dubs \"the End Sky\", where the world will be destroyed and reborn. The clock is ticking and more people die as the prophesied date draws closer and closer while Yuki attempts to get to the bottom of the identity of Mamiya Takuji, the Web Bot Project and the End Sky.[/spoiler]\n\n[Edited from Asceai's [url=http://www.menhelmate.org/2010/04/subarashiki-hibi-furenzoku-sonzai.html]review[/url]]",

The only other people around are a quiet white-haired girl and their overseer, Izumo. As three separate stories unfold around him, Kaito begins to wake up to the truth of this world, and his own role in it. And it's all connected to the strange, silent girl named Yonagi...\n\n[b]CASE-1 Hatano Rin[/b]\nArishima Kaoru is a 45-year old part-time teacher, stuck in an unhappy marriage and living a life of tedium after having long given up on his dreams of becoming a novelist.\n\nOne day, he finds out that a student of his, Hatano Rin, is none other than the daughter of the writer he once admired above all others.\n\nAs the relationship between the two deepens, Arishima grapples with immoral impulses toward this younger girl. But even as his life spirals and his marriage crumbles further, he picks up his pen and starts to write again.\n\n[b]CASE-2 Olivia Berry[/b]\nOur stage is set in the heyday of Elizabethan theater, a time where women were prohibited from acting on stage.\n\nA young William Shakespeare runs a failing pub together with his blind father. Blessed with a perfect memory, he uses the tales his patrons tell as inspiration for the plays he writes to earn extra income.\n\nWhen his fate ends up in the hands of one Olivia Berry, a woman with a fiery personality and a fierce sense of purpose, Will finds himself in the midst of a real-life drama of his own.\n\n[b]CASE-3 Momonouchi Sumomo[/b]\nAmei Kanna is a college dropout who spends his time holed up in his dad's garage trying to fix his late mother's old, beat up camper van.\n\nBut when a young teacher-in-training shows up out of the blue, she provides the spark to get him out of his mancave and into the world again.\n\nTogether with the self-styled scrap hunter Azuki, they set out on an adventure to find the special place Kanna's mother left behind in a drawing.\n\nAs Halley's comet streaks across the sky, the three share an unforgettable summer of sweet beginnings and bitter ends.\n\n---\n\nAfter experiencing these stories and bidding farewell to them, the threads converge in the truth of one girl.\n\n[Edited from [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607200/Cyanotype_Daydream_The_Girl_Who_Dreamed_the_World/]Steam[/url]]",
